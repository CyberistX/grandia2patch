# Grandia 2 Patch

A custom launcher that fixes some bugs of the retail (CD) version of Grandia 2 when running on modern versions of Windows, featuring DLL injection, runtime code patching and Windows API hooking.

It fixes an issue with the window border, scales the game to fit the screen resolution and applies a NoCD patch.

To run, simply build the project and drop the launcher in the Grandia 2 folder. 
You will also need to copy the files from the CD2 into the program's installation directory and to set gompatibility mode for Grandia2.exe to Windows XP Service Pack 2.
